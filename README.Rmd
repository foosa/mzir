## Overview

`mzir` is an R package for plotting datasets from the Mach-Zehnder interferometric chemical sensor project.  Datasets are structured file folders in the following format:

```
dataset/            # Folder name is unimportant
  meta.json         # Stores metadata (chip ID, film ID, notes, etc.)
  intervals.csv     # Stores intervals data (time vs concentration)
  data.csv          # Raw interferometer output (time vs phase shift)
```

Data analysis consists of the following steps:

  #. Load and validate the dataset
  #. Adjust the intervals
  #. Align the intervals
  #. Fit the data within each interval to a model
  #. Sensitivity analysis
  #. Save processed results and plots
  

## Usage

`mzir` can be run in an interactive mode where it walks the user through the data analysis process, or as a regular R library.
